Easily support ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ by joining in the DDOS effort. Here's how, in **4** steps:



## 1. Set up a VPN.

Protect yourself by make your connections come from a different location than your own. I use Express VPN, but there are many alternatives. Here's what that looks like when it's up and running:

## 2. Disable CORS in your browser.

This allows the code to make the network connections. I use a separate profile in Chrome with the [Allow CORS](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf) extension. If you use Allow CORS (it's the easiest way I've found), just change Option 4 to `*`:

Then, be sure to actually turn on the extension itself. The "C" logo will appear orange:

## 3. Browse to [russia-must-be-stopped.html](https://codergator.github.io/russia-must-be-stopped/russia-must-be-stopped.html).

Here's [the source code](https://github.com/codergator/russia-must-be-stopped/blob/master/russia-must-be-stopped.html), if you want to examine it. It's pretty simple, IMO.


## 4. Enable mixed content.

This allows all the URLs to be loaded, even the ones over `http`.
