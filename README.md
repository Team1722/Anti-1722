Easily support ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ by joining in the DDoS effort. Here's how, in **4** steps:



## 1. Set up a VPN.

Protect yourself by make your connections come from a different location than your own. I use Express VPN, but there are many alternatives. Here's what that looks like when it's up and running. I've got mine set to have all my Internet come and go through Phoenix, USA:

## 2. Disable CORS in your browser.

This is essential: it allows the code to make the network connections. I use a separate profile in Chrome with the [Allow CORS](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf) extension. If you use Allow CORS (it's the easiest way I've found), just change Option 4 to `*`:

Then, be sure to actually turn on the extension itself. The "C" logo will appear orange:

## 3. Browse to [russia-must-be-stopped.html](https://codergator.github.io/russia-must-be-stopped/russia-must-be-stopped.html).

Here's [the source code](https://github.com/codergator/russia-must-be-stopped/blob/master/russia-must-be-stopped.html), if you want to examine it. It's pretty simple, IMO.


## 4. Enable mixed content.

At this point, the script is running, but can only connect to the sites that use `https`.
But some of these Russian sites are still on `http`. In order to hit those as well, we need
to enable "mixed content" (a mix of `https` and `http`). 

### Instructions for the Chrome Browser

First, click the lock to the left of the URL, then click **Site settings**:

Then, on the Site settings page, scroll down to the **Insecure content** setting:

Change it to **Allow**:

You'll probably have to reload the page to pick up the new setting. Chrome gives a helpful button for that:

And you're **done**. Your browser will load all the URLs, even the ones over `http`.



## 5. Verify it's working.

Welcome to step #5 out of 4. You should probably make sure this is actually working correctly. It took me several tries to get it right. To do this, open up the Javascript Console. On the Mac, it's alt-cmd-j. You can also right-click on the page, choose **Inspect**, and then switch to the **Console**. It should look like this:

<img width="1101" alt="Screen Shot 2022-03-01 at 7 59 56 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16888908/156197919-77eb63aa-13ce-4683-91a2-9c02c304310e.png">

Uncheck **Group similar messages in console**. Now it should look like this:

<img width="1101" alt="Screen Shot 2022-03-01 at 7 59 52 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16888908/156198025-762c200a-ddd2-4660-9882-6dabf4e351eb.png">

Notice how the browser is complaining about the mixed content, but it's going ahead and loading it anyway. Because I enabled it in Step 4.

But if your console looks like this, then you didn't properly enable mixed content. Go back and try again:
