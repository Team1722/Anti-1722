Easily join in the DDOS effort. Here's how:

1. **Set up a VPN.** Make your connections come from a different location than your own. I use Express VPN, but there are many options. Here's what that looks like when it's up and running:

2. **Disable CORS in your browser.** This allows the code to make the network connections. I use Chrome with [Allow CORS](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf). If you use this extension (it's the easiest way I've found), just change Option 4 to `*`:

Then, be sure to actually turn on the extension itself. The "C" logo will appear orange:

4. **Enable mixed content.** This allows all the URLs to be loaded, even the ones over `http`.
